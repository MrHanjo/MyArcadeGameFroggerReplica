===============================

FORWARD: 
Thank you for wanting to play this variant version of the classic Frogger game. This game is in its first functioning phase. 

TO BEGIN:
Open the index.html file in an internet browser such as Chrome, Firefox, or Opera.

STORY:
Ninja girl has trained her entire life and has run into an opportunity to get rich fast so she can live her life lavishly.  There has been rumor of valuable gems that have been appearing in an abandoned part of the world.  Mutant insects have infested this forbidden zone, but the same scientific misadventures that created these monsters have also created these gems.  Ninja girl will use her ninja skills to access this area, and her magic to create a portal that will allow her to teleport these treasures back to her secret hideout.  It is your job to control Ninja girl to collect these gems and avoid these bugs!  Her mission is to collect at least a million dollars worth of gems. Let's go get her rich!

PLAYING THE GAME:
Use the arrow keys to move Ninja girl UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.  
You can toggle the music ON and PAUSE with the M key.
You have infinite lives.  Once you've collect a million dollars, you will have won the game and a message will alert you.

NOTES AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:
This is a class project for my education at UDACITY.

Music from Kraid's Lair on Metroid for NES.  Nintendo Co., Ltd.
Sound Effects from Castlevania for NES.  Konami Holdings 	Corporation.

Problem with background music not starting up on intial load from Opera and Chrome browsers. Firefox seems to be exempt from this problem. There was an autoplay policy change on Chrome and other browser on April 2018. See the following URL for more information:
https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/09/autoplay-policy-changes

Problems with having 'lives' in the game.  For example, if the game is begun with 5 lives; one death would strangely subtract 4 or more from a lives variable.  The function was discarded for the moment as enough has been accomplished to submit this project.

Future possibilities may include, fluid movement with the Player, Player attacking, Levels, Level Bosses, etc.
